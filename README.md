## WinterOrb Frontend

WinterOrb is a website based on the game Path of Exile featuring price history data for items and a price prediction system that uses the previous pricing to try and predict future prices. It is an under-development project that will feature more features down the line. Heavily inspired by https://poe.ninja and https://poe.watch

## Setup

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to install dependencies and start the webserver locally. A `.env` file should contain the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` value to fetch the data from.
