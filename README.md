## WinterOrb Frontend

WinterOrb is a website based on the game Path of Exile featuring price history data for items and a price prediction system that uses the previous pricing to try and predict future prices. It is an under-development project that will feature more features down the line. Heavily inspired by https://poe.ninja and https://poe.watch
